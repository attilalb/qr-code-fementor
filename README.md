## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

How to code simple, static elements based off a screenshot while adhering to a style guide.

### Continued development

I'm currently focusing on learning to create complex UIs with React instead of static HTML.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - Using SCSS is a great way to improve your CSS workflows. If you're unfamiliar with Sass, read through the guide to learn how to integrate it into your work.
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - Flexbox can be challenging to grasp at first, but this simple game helps you learn it in a fun and quick way.
